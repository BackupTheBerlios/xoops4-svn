XMT - Xoops Modern Theme
A theme to celebrate Xoops 2.1 release
Version: 0.1
Author: ralf57 , the whole xoops community
Based on kavaXtreme's Kubrick flexible

The upcoming release of version 2.1 will make our preferred
CMS a big step forward.
The default theme which is bundled with every release
starting form 2.0 has not ever really changed/improved instead.
So i thought 2.1 version would deserve a great theme.
I started designing a new theme and named it XMT which
stands for Xoops Modern Theme.
With the help of you all we can give Xoops a new,great,
well tested default theme to build our sites on.
Thank you in advance for your contribution.
